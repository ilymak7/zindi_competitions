11,"beekeeping and beekeeping office When did beekeeping start? Beekeeping started in a very different way. They visited us at a school in Chiradzulu and what attracted you. When I thought about it, I realized that beekeeping does not have to do a lot of things like farming, buying fertilizers, etc. what attracted me was that people nowadays prefer to use honey as a sweetener rather than sugar due to various physical conditions so I saw that its market is not cheap and its money is rich we put my honey in bottles do you do this farming in balaka lilongwe and blantyre how many drums do you have I started with hives but now it has reached the balaka there are hives in lilongwe and in blantyre so how much honey do you get for each hive when it is winter months I get kilograms for each hive when the temperature drops to honey because when the bees arrive, the bees have made enough food to stay in their hive and eat. One of the reasons for this increase is that we come from a rainy season where honey and flowers are plentiful. how about one bee hive produce k100 when it is a problem k60 how do you get honey markets are not needed because there are few farmers but they are using it and many companies have been finding me to sell them honey but due to the large number of my customers I can't afford it Personally, did you learn the techniques of beekeeping that no one taught me or where I studied beekeeping as a child? When I went to Lilongwe I saw people doing farming using pots and pans and when I saw how they did the first idea to build the drums they came back to me. I was lucky when the world vision organization gave me a business to make drums for them so at that time I learned a lot about farming. The most important part of the farm is the land and the hives. The farmer needs to have a well-developed environment such as trees and water if he does not have such a place but he wants to plant fast trees such as papayas and moringa should be at a distance of less than an inch from the houses of the people. This farming does not take up much of the area because with just one acre the farmer can do great things. In our hive at the entrance and the poles we put on top of the hives the beeswax helps to make bees in the hive so when they smell it they come in and settle down when we leave and we attach our hive to the branches of the tree When bees enter and settle things like ants spider mice and mice hate bees so if one of them is found in a hive there is nothing the farmer can do to the farmers if they find such things in the hive they have to get rid of it. How long does it take to harvest hives after harvest the bees are doing it"

Ask him what he thinks about these organizations. He said it was important to persuade Malawians to trust them again based on the past. It was a good idea but it was difficult to achieve because from the beginning there was a lack of co-operation between the organizations themselves. they have lost faith since the year when the leaders of the organizations called for a national strike but in the end some people were killed and soon after the organizations stopped the protests which were the backbone. He said the need was to start making one point that would show that their goal was the same or that there was nothing to gain from it but to no avail. Sembereka emphasized that the trip forward would be different from any previous one in that it would be more constructive and constructive and would rely on dialogue rather than pointing fingers at some Malawians who spoke to Tvani. He said it was disappointing that the organizations exaggerated that they were human rights activists and criticized when the government was wrong but in the end it seemed like a way to pray for responsibilities. How many government officials have given hope to Malawians and then shut the mouths of the Malawians who need them so much that many of us may not be able to name them all. That is a source of frustration. He said he did not have any tears in his eyes. In the past few years we have seen that it has been used and discarded as useless. Many people have agreed to go on strike in the cities because of their faith, but within a few months many leaders began to take sides, leaving us handcuffed, said Banda. after seeing that"

Justice link justine dzonzi and the head of the malawi human rights watchdog watch billy banda said this week if the government is not ready to talk about rescuing malawi people from the crisis that has plagued the country, it is better for President thunder Mutharika to rest without discrimination Secretary of State Patricia Kaliati said this was a riot and a lie because the government had not been invited to the talks. She said she did not believe the meeting was open to anyone because the council had expelled some journalists from the meeting if they were expelled. We would not have been evicted if they had insulted us that we had not been there, so what if they were still there? Blantyre from Wednesday to Thursday last week convened a meeting of state parishioners, chiefs of state media, legal experts and human rights activists, except for kings and state officials, but Pac Robert Hill said his party had sent a letter to the three kings to attend the talks. only one king came and he said he was surprised by the king who came and stayed for a while and came back without knowing why the mountain said the government had sent them a letter to attend the talks but there was not a single face.

Zambia has made it clear that he will not relinquish his responsibilities as a minister. He also said that he did not see anything wrong with him despite his involvement in the purchase of maize from Zambia to save the people from hunger. This is because instead of buying the maize cheaply from the Zambian cooperative federation zcf maize sellers in zambia the malawi government through the agency Admarc decided to buy the maize at a high price through a Zambian NGO called kaloswe commuter and courier limited as a mediator for using the company to buy tons of maize. The Malawian government spent K26 billion owed to the east and southern african bank and development also known as pta bank if they had just bought the maize from zcf the government would have spent about k15 billion only this means that the malawi government has spent about k9 billion more on buying maize through kaloswe commuter and courier limited ho how much money the question is why? The only way to get maize at such a high price is to use it at the lowest possible price.

Most of the trees are trapped so it is not difficult because one can stay for a few weeks without watering but the trees do not die. Are the trees just planted as long as the trees or not? Of course it is important to consider when choosing trees. and its location as there are some windbreaks that need to be deep rooted to withstand the force of the wind there are also some groundbreaking trees that need to be well rooted to keep the water flowing but in terms of agriculture we also encourage planting fertile trees for farmers to discuss How to get a tree seedling?

The plan is currently underway because it is the only policy that can alleviate hunger and poverty in the country. Don't be out and re-built. The legislature has risen to meet its promises. It was the billionaires who entered into the program, which benefited the poor, according to the band. I agree, but as long as the policy is successful, he said. The study found that the policy raises many questions as to whether the country should continue with the policy and how long the country should continue with the policy. However, a report released by the government in March this year criticized the policy of not paying the k120 million fertilizer to benefit the poor, a report confirmed by the government. According to the report, the money was from the bags of fertilizer. Do you think that the proceeds from the program should be used to buy K60 billion worth of maize? This is a lot of money. What do you think? instead of handing it to him because every day he knocks on your door to give it to him. The plan is to teach people how to fish for themselves and not to teach them to beg. Yes, the system is in dire straits but we are trying to get it right The decline in the number of recipients should be attributed to the increase in the number of people last year and the increase in the cost of fertilizer due to the current economic crisis. In this country, it is expected that the equipment will soon be available in some areas before the onset of the rains but the band thinks that the government has deliberately increased funding for the program to start other projects. He believes that K60 billion is only enriching others and not helping the poor.

384,"he talked about love and dating grandpa on wenela has changed so much he met we met at school in chiradzulu how is dating and love different maybe this question may seem silly but to me it is very important another question is if a man likes to promise a boyfriend or lover that they will marry all the wife does not promise her husband then in this case the man can continue the relationship or just leave her lf area lilongwe dear lf a person can have many friends but one lover often people can not distinguish between love and dating love is deeper than dating love comes from the heart and time In fact, when two people are in love, especially between a man and a woman, they get along so well that they end up agreeing and swearing that they will be together for the rest of their lives in a relationship where the relationship can be mutually exclusive but often different. That is why a man can have many friends even if you are married as I have said before but the one you end up with is the only one of your love. Your second question. The answer is that in our culture the man is the one who proposes to the woman and he is the one who tells the woman his intentions. Many women are ashamed to say that they have allowed the whole affair in their heart. They have already agreed. So the man must understand and be gentle and not rash because you can block the view of the woman thinking that the woman is not saying anything when there is love. but i no i have a man who wants to show up at our house but i don't like him very much even though he loves me so much then he says he will marry me for the next four years now i have met someone but he says he will marry me for the next two years so what can i do grandma lc area lilongwe thank you lc my child what you want i don't know what kind of man you want to marry or who wants to get married right now even though he doesn't like the problem what is the matter with the man who says he loves you and wants to marry you four years ago why did you let him go first a man who says he is getting married for the next two years especially what do you want me to help you with in this matter it is all up to you but what I can advise you is that not all men have true love one can say we should get married today but in his heart there is no love when someone says We will be dating for four years and then we will get married for various reasons. In English there is a saying that every day it is dark and when you are poor keep your neck white necklace will be worn. Others say to see the snail's eyes and calm down. All these words teach us to be gentle. We will look for the good in the future and not be overly demanding, as I said before, it is up to you because you know what you want but if I were you I would give the opportunity to a man who has shown real love for me even if he says he took the time to marry me."

To prevent power outages the company advised the council to fix the fault before the lights came on but nothing has been done in some areas poles have passed at the very bottom of our power lines and escom rules do not allow electricity to be connected in such places in some places poles are too far apart. to install electricity in such places said Chota but Chafunya said that when the poles are destroyed it is difficult to replace them because the cost involved is too much to repair a single cement polo. It costs K400 to build and install it, then calculate how much one road costs for poles and if people destroy it for us to rehabilitate then other development projects will take place in Blantyre.

The expert said that the problem that a farmer may face in keeping the field is because of beetles. He said the problem is not serious because he can overcome it. The farmer can choose to keep his potato in the pot and use it later or take it out slowly until it runs out he said the potter is a potato storage pot and the farmer digs accordingly He said the farmer had to sort his potatoes into sections. He explained that at the top of each section they had to sprinkle ashes or sand and when the pit was full they would bury it when they left.

643,"What do you mean when you say 'tonde smells'? What do you mean? There are many different meanings. When you hear a tune, the head boils. I am a village headman. What do you mean by that? The first thing you know is that the words are just a proverb and as you know the proverb is said in order for the audience to take a lesson or warning based on what has happened. Or it may be that there were no goats at the meeting, which is why the word is used in the proverb to mean that it does not represent anyone but that there is a lesson we want people to learn, for example, the conference was about environmental protection through various means. What does this proverb mean? Well, the proverb says that a person's hard work is what testifies to his hard work. The results of his hard work tell a lot about him without anyone standing around and preaching. For example, a hardworking farmer is known for his hard work. just because it means that a goat is just a hiding place and that doesn't mean we are talking about a goat because it smells like a goat. This is just a way to give lessons or advice and encouragement so that the people in the meeting know that everyone here should be judged by the results of their work and not just by word of mouth. The fact that when a goat is born with a goat often, the respect goes to the buck because he is the one who works in it. He did not smell the smell because as soon as his male buck entered the barn and started giving birth, he received praise as a buck because the fruits were visible. Nera used this proverb when he found another proverb as long as the saying that he had dug a quail because then it is related that the quail also has a stench in the nose and not a game."

Malawian president watch billy banda and political analyst henry chingaipe told tvani this week as he looks at how the government is wasting people's taxes to save itself while Malawians are on fire for example they talk about how the people's taxes have been ruined by the united nations un He said in the wake of the economic crisis in the country, it is not necessary for the government to take the kings on a tour with a large number of people who are responsible for the destruction of the economy without considering Malawians destroying ants according to reports. The nation's newspaper on Tuesday last week estimated that K308 million would be spent on the trip. He said it is not true that the government is accumulating and forgetting Malawians because whatever the government is doing is good for the Malawians there are trips that need to be made so we have not forgotten that it is true that there are other kings on the journey who are jealous but there is a need to know that the government is working with kings ""This is happening when NGOs and people have criticized government officials for reducing travel. The government should remember where it came from. We have blamed the Malawian government for the dpp tax evasion and this is not uncommon for them but we are surprised that they have also started the same thing here they have become galaxies he said many times with him it would be worse if the government was failing to reduce spending especially on travel.

648,"fears of cheating on jce exams The country's education administration will be disappointed with the decision of the maneb exam board to allow some students to sit for this year's junior certificate of education jce exams without proof id to get out and be arrested again. The head of civil society education coalition csec benedicto kondowe said this could lead to cheating in the by-elections. they do not have ids and it is amazing how the test takers know the students if they are right this teacher or any other person can write another test exam without knowing it because the function of id helps the test administrators to identify as a mother Kondowe said it was against the rules of the exam which barred a student who did not have a number or ID to write the exam. The examiners had all gone to high school. They said that almost all the students had taken the exams but added that it was difficult to say how many students did not have IDs. The exams started. We did our best to send the remaining certificates four days after the start of the examination and now all the students with their certificates have said no. o criticized the allegations and said that during this week's examination, they found that some students were writing without certificates. We found some students in other schools in the central and shire highlands writing without certificates, so when they presented the certificates, they were shocked to hear about the fraud allegations. Maneb, with the help of exam administrators and school officials, helps to identify students who enter the examination room, but Kondowe said the whole group knows the children well and the school authorities so if they want to cheat they can deceive their classmates. We have heard that school officials are arrested or fined for cheating. ""How can a student who admits mistakes and changes the system to make things worse?"" he said. Kondowe said the Maneb Examination Program clearly indicates the time when candidates who are expected to sit for examinations should have to pay for the certificates and then the council must issue the certificates before the Ministry of Education has washed their hands of the issue. His job is to make sure that the syllabus runs smoothly. If the children did not complete the syllabus, it would be ours because that is the part we are dealing with."

When you ask about my views on such a relationship, my answer is that it is one of the best ways for people to share ideas and to communicate. Women's union is called a ski but in short it is called a ski and one woman can have several slices at the same time without any problems or worries. Where does the name come from? The name does not confuse you. It is derived from the English word secret. based on what happens in the relationship here I mean what the mother and the friend or her friends are doing in their relationship you can elaborate on what happens during the relationship the mother buys each other gifts They are secretly different and give each other the secret of the English. They say secret as I have said before, so in order not to get around they just say how is the secret that there is a beginning. But the main point lies in the fact that the two people are in a relationship. or they have met at a place or other event such as a church in a dance club at a meeting and other places so how does it start when people agree blood can negotiate to start a kisiki but sometimes one just starts sending a gift to the other and then the other just returns the prize first. especially in a woman's life a woman has more stress and guilt in her heart than a man so if a woman does not have a partner to confide in her in such cases her life will be a bit stressful and Things do not go well, but when she is with her partner, she can pour out her frustrations and problems on the other side of her body and lighten the burden of worrying and worrying. What I mean is that there are other worries and concerns that need to be interpreted or encouraged.

He came out and was arrested again. He stopped the parliament and went up to fulfill his promises. He said that although he knew that killing was wrong, it was not right to let the children out of the hut because he would suffer from a herbalist in Mchinji. Ethel Banda said that in the past, he did not come out of the hut When a baby is born with strange limbs, adults can deliberately pass it on to the baby so that sometimes the mother does not know. Some people believe that the baby causes problems. They can pass it on to her and say that she is already dead. The only question to consider is that life is the same regardless of the appearance of the baby. The question we need to ask ourselves is whether to look different can make a baby less human than a baby born of a mother and father and a human being. According to one of the world's leading psychiatrists, the story of the mysterious birth of a child has caused a great deal of controversy in the world. When such babies are born, the midwives are often left to fend for themselves. He said some believe that parents can find it very difficult to care for such children and that they could bring disaster on them in Greece long after they were born and strangled. After birth, parents should take their children to adults and leave them exposed because they say they will not be a responsible citizen. he says but this is so the island says people know that life is a precious thing so fixing babies because of this is wrong parents believe that after giving birth to children to stand alone these children can be difficult to stand on their own so this issue is important to ask the parents their opinion says the constitution provides for the right of life to all persons, and the fourth provision of the Constitution states that everyone has the right to life, and no person has the right to take the life of another person except in death. Harriet Petyepye, head of the National Association of Nurses and Midwives, said in a statement that the practice was a violation of the rights of innocent people through trivial means. no matter how serious the problem is after birth, the nurses and midwives in this country are taught how to prevent such abuse and how to counsel mothers who claim to be a child with a disability."

You mean, after the baby dies two months before the parents are in the same place, the ritual is like a continuous baby. because we believe that the baby is not warmed by the father how does it go when the baby dies it is only buried by the mothers but the women are not allowed to mourn the funeral because the mourning prevents the mother from giving birth again the grave is not as deep as an adult's funeral why did they not go deep if the grave of a cold baby is too deep the mother of the baby will not give birth again then what do you do when the twins die when one of the twins cries at the funeral we believe that the remaining child dies and when we bury them We put the dead baby and the balm next to her so that her soul can see if she is still with her partner. What do you do with her? We bathe her in medicine so that her friend's spirit does not return to her. Now you say you were a midwife. You gave birth to a miscarriage. No child born to me.

974,"One of the legal experts, Kanyongolo, has said that the law on property and wealth of the country's leaders should be reviewed with the aim of giving more power to Malawians who want to find the leaders who are using them.

The taxman has a budget to buy food and household items every five years. These leaders also have the right to import one of their private vehicles without paying duty to the tax collection agency. malawi revenue authorization mra for a long time some leaders have been using the power and freedom that the law gives them to import goods for various businesses but do not pay taxes to mra which is against the laws of this country to combat this practice the government established a special law commission slc this year In order to review the constitutional mandate, the main function of which was to amend the law on the president and other government officials to disclose their financial status before being sworn in for various positions. In addition, the commission found that in addition to the law requiring leaders to come forward with exports to countries such as Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania, they have provided additional policies and guidelines to determine whether their leaders' wealth increases through their responsibilities as president, minister or member of parliament. in other respects, the Commission agreed that a public servant should not use his or her position to accumulate wealth for himself or her or his or her associates and should not engage in any other activity except for that purpose. So it seems that Malawians do not have the power and the law to protect them when it comes to managing the finances of their leaders. Nyongolo said this was a sign of weakening of the country's laws and that was why leaders were taking advantage of the situation. He said the law on the assets of the vice president and the cabinet was adequate but lacked the pillars that the common people could use to manage the economy. Parliament should consider enacting another law to force leaders to return to the public with the money they earn when they step down. They say they would like the financial intelligence unit fiawi and malawi revenue authority once they are given the power to monitor the financial status of leaders every four months or at the end of the year."

He was disappointed with the news of the election because he was frustrated with the practice of leaders who promise certain things during the campaign but do not deliver when they are elected. United Democrat front spokesman Df Ken Nganga said their investigation showed that the MEC had not disseminated enough information to the constituencies. When we asked them, they did not register the people in the constituencies. united transformation movement utm patricia kaliati and malawi congress party secretary general mcp eissenhower milk joined the protest in criticizing mec He said his party, which has been asking the mec to repeat the census in some areas, expected that by the fourth phase of the census, things would have changed but instead it was getting worse in the first and second phases. ""The message was not widely disseminated but in the fourth phase we will talk about it. No, it is not true. Mec would have seen it better."" ""People are not showing interest and I have asked councilors even though people say they have not received any information that the census is taking place in their area which means that there is still work to be done,"" said Dua."

Even though people are building roofs and tin cans, we are still drinking from unsafe wells. This leads to diseases that we also suffer from in the hospital,"" said Chindi Chindi. The mother would wake up in the morning to fetch water as soon as the sun rose a little later so in her house you could see that the water was from the tap but not from the well, ""said Chindi's lawyer. This is a very hot issue, but in the case of water, before we lie, things are getting worse and worse, but the number of people who are looking for clean water is still increasing, ""said the census at the start of the study. he only received k20 instead of the K120 he was supposed to receive after training for the job. Other staff members complained that they did not get a mobile phone to work on the project. The office and Kingsley Graves confirmed the incident but said everything was in order. Now everything was fine. They all received their money. We have confirmed that the units have arrived this week but those who want the phone. This is a network problem that we are using. We have a network that we are using to call the network. He did not name himself. Zomba lones of Zomba Lones District said the minutes he was asked about the questions were beneficial to himself and the country and his questions were to unravel the issues that Malawians, if answered honestly, will help our country to prosper. The annual census is found to be a report. This census shows that people in the population are drinking water from wells. Everybody is drinking from unprotected wells. The report also shows."

1001,"wilfred lipita says farmers need to learn from last year's agricultural experience and choose the right crop for this year's crop. He said today it is difficult to predict that the rains will start today and will end tomorrow. The best way is to choose early-maturing crops. He said there are fast-growing crops out there that if the rains cut off along the way, the farmer can get some rest instead of sticking to the perennial crops because this is what can cause hunger. He added that while farmers are planting traditional crops such as maize, beans, tobacco, etc. He should also consider other drought-tolerant crops such as cassava and potatoes in his previous advice. We say it is safe because even if the rains are short it still produces no matter how big or small the roots are but the issue is that if some crops fail the farmer has a handle he said go to many places maize came out and He said the weeds growing in the bush are degraded and do not produce well even if the farmer spends a lot of money to buy fertilizer for maize. This is the first time to consider weeding and when it comes to knees and time He added that when the maize is vigorous, its yield will be desirable and if the crop is good, one stalk will produce two or three stalks at harvest and it will be like two fields when it was one."

Such people find it difficult to live under a woman's leadership because they just feel that the person who is ruling them should not do so. It is difficult to correct it when it comes to growing up, so much of the responsibility for correcting sexual misconduct rests with the parents to ensure that the people you raise have the right beliefs and practices without oppressing or abusing others because of the birth of abused mothers and sons. The caregiver should not be like the father who abuses his wife when he grows up. The boys should be taught to respect the woman. If someone wants to have sex with them or make fun of them, they blow their whistles when they walk the streets and we teach them that they have the ability to reach and be whatever they want in life. of what a father is doing to earn money at home they can also make a girl not focus her mind on her body there are skills, wisdom and other things she has been blessed with to benefit her and the world and educate her daughter not to let anyone drag her down be told at an early age to resist and not tolerate any form of abuse"

The secret lies in how to cultivate them. on the rainy season when there is no rainy season and when the vegetables are low but the consumers are many here is where the wise farmer has to work and what benefits you get from farming you understand and calculate how much people spend at the end of the month buying tomatoes and vegetables to eat every day at their home you can see that they spend a lot of money that if the leaves were grown on their own then this money would be used to make other necessities for their home so we don't buy anything about vegetables and we sell the leaves to show that we kill two birds with this method of farming for this reason the money we have saved by not buying the vegetables we are making various improvements in our home here what problems are you facing and how do you deal with the big problem with water So the water came a long way when we dug the well so we hired people to fetch water from the well and pour it into the barrels we use and water the seeds. Irrigation is very useful for example planting tomatoes trees and its seeds produce good results because it can produce at least one tomato so for each tree each tree produces at least one tomato so for example one tomato sells for k50 muk they have calculated how to get the cabbage and cabbage that we grow with the best seed which one we sell for k250 so if we plant more you can see how many kwacha has been killed. beans beetroot brocolli have gold in its natural environment so if a farmer grows this in a way that poverty can have control over his life as a country what can we do for irrigated agriculture to benefit the country needs farmers to change their mindset and accept that"

This is what the parents mean in this proverb. as long as the implication is that there is a need for caution especially in conducting research that is not just a waste of time but the real source in the introduction of this proverb is the issue of marriage."

We met at a school in Chiradzulu to run an agroforestry food security program aimed at ensuring that farmers live. Dr Bruce Sosola said the use of fertilizer trees could increase yields by three times in the field. He said this during a visit to the tree nursery in the second term where he said he was satisfied with the work of farmers in rehabilitating the environment. gliricidia can be used in conjunction with crops such as maize while others need to be planted interchangeably with the crop and can be used for two or three years before the farmer plants and another for planting in the nursery. soil research previous research showed that farmers could benefit greatly from this method because they bring in less money for their crops. Sosola said one of the benefits of these trees is that they absorb nitrogen salts and store them in their leaves and absorb the natural salts that escape from the ground and bring it to the surface for use by plants other than gliricidia Sosola said there are other trees such as katupe tephrosia sesbania cajanus and faidherbia which are also used to restore soil fertility. He said the seeds of these trees are easily accessible and farmers can get them through the fields. He said the council provides advice to farmers who are interested in pursuing this method of making a profit. He also said that some of the farmers he has trained in the past have become independent and are also working to educate their fellow farmers. dorothy themba from the church in lilongwe testified that her family has benefited greatly from this method they said they are now harvesting about three times the amount of seed they plant compared to what they originally harvested on the same field i realized later that this method is more profitable in the first year here the pre-existing trees actually work

The Electoral Commission (NEC) has ruled that the registration process will allow for registration of persons who are under the age of majority, but there is evidence that the age will be reached by the closing date of registration, which allows a person who has reached the age of registration to register. The closing date for the registration of November was announced by the MEC.

After harvesting, they wait for a few days. The farmer simply enters the field and begins to peel the corn on each stalk until it has finished the whole field. What are the advantages of placing the piles? If the soil is in the stalk for a few days, another advantage is that it helps the farmer to remove all the maize from the field because at first it is as if he has removed all the maize stalks and put them together and the stalks take one stalk until they finish the stalks by placing the stalks separately. The maize is still wet on the chicken and some of it is damaged. Once the maize is on the stalk, it is overgrown with ants. The disadvantage is that it is difficult to cultivate the stalks because the farmer seems to have removed the stalks. What is the advantage of breaking the stalk? The stalks are laid on the ground to rot. What is the disadvantage of this method? What if the maize is not harvested before drying? The farmer has to dry it at home and dry it until it is completely dry. allow it because otherwise the maize will remain in the field and what are the precautions for the farmer to be careful when harvesting the first crop when he removes the maize from the stalks and puts them in a heap so that they do not throw away because some of them are lost in the field? take it home and keep it from sticking to the ground where there may be moisture something after the farmer has harvested the whole field he has to go and make sure all the corn has been removed from the field and what is your last word to the farmers when they are preparing to harvest maize because it causes chukwu chukwu is dangerous because it releases toxins that reduce it"

So we listened intently so that by the end of the week we would be able to dance and hear all the rituals that my grandfather used to teach us and our grandfather taught us to dance this day. We all stayed in the house for a whole week when our friends at school said that if a man left you, why would the elders say that if a man only found someone and taught us what to do, there was something else you learned, yes, he also punished rude girls for the same virginity. all the rudeness they do to their parents did this virginity help you to eat faster with the intention of doing what you learned on my part not really because the counselors predicted that we should keep it until the day we get married but I know my fellow girls who got pregnant because they wanted to practice what we learned. Sometimes parents send their children to puberty when they are deaf. These are girls who do not serve their parents. This means that they are being punished on the other side as I said before. The problem is that grandparents exchange songs and call each other names and say bad things about their parents, for example, Jane said fetch water from the swamp and the respondent said no, I don't want it. This helps to end the child. It helps because it comes out of a change. The rudeness ends there. Entering this virginity this virginity enters with a young girl not entering children but years later and she should have fallen to the ground so when the day of departure came and what advice did you receive from the adults were advising us not to stop dancing to get used to this tree can you stop dancing. of course, the virginity is still there, of course, the virginity has ended due to the advent of various rights education and advocacy groups for girls not to rush into marriage but to persevere in school. Wika did this because the children were absent from school for a whole week which disrupted their studies and said it was one of the reasons why girls dropped out of school and got married early."

The head of the Malawi Economic Coalition justce network mejn Blessing said that the economic plan should take into account the poor.

The king said the next budget should focus on budgeted food for future crises in the coming months. The economy was priced at K635 billion and the government did not rely on foreign currency because the donor countries had refused to provide funding to the country due to previous government spending cuts.

We use the canals and when the water level is low, this poses a risk of extinction, he said, according to the Irrigation Specialist at the US Agricultural Research Institute, Isaac, when it rains less than the water table, the English water table lowers its effects. irrigated farmers do not have access to water but he explained that farmers could reduce the problem by reducing the use of irrigation water. The expert explained that farmers could reduce the use of water for irrigation with less water or the use of irrigation water. drip irrigation in English when a farmer covers the crop with stalks while doing irrigation it helps to keep the water from escaping from the soil faster and as a result it stays in the soil for a long time. In this case, the farmer does not irrigate frequently. This helps to keep the area where the farmer gets water for example, for example from a well in a dam or a river, because it is like keeping some of it, ”he said. He said that this method helps to save or store water that has been irrigated in the fields or in other containers and therefore gives the farmer the opportunity to use the water for a longer period of time. He is the Deputy Director of Irrigation, Geoffrey Mwepa. This type of irrigation reduces water loss by almost a fraction of this. This is the case because the irrigation system The only source of essential water for the crop is without over-fertilization, such as the whole field, for example, Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources Lecturer Luanar Paul Fatch added that planting trees around the farmer's access to irrigation water helps the area. he said this is because it protects the water from flying too high"

The registration process is underway in the central region. Three Mozambican nationals have already been arrested in Dedza District for trying to register the registry at a registration center with the help of a Malawian woman. Dedza Police Spokesman Edward Kabango said Mozambicans should be careful. Chewami is one of the oldest people in Angonia, Mozambique, where the woman, Angellina Lameck, from the village of Kapalamula in Dedza, will appear in court soon after the registration of the National Registration Bureau (NRB Norman) has been confirmed.

Mozambican nationals were found to be in possession of Mozambican citizenship certificates and admitted that they were serious about obtaining Malawian citizenship. He said the suspects were being charged with perjury against the registrar's office in violation of the NRB's code of conduct. In doing so, the department was seeking evidence from royalty or other licenses such as driving licenses. A birth certificate or a marriage certificate stating that a person is a Malawian here means that the person who wants to help foreigners get citizenship certificates should help them to get all this evidence which also means that within the system there has been a corruption case which is another legal case in this country. Police spokesman James Kader said the practice was a setback. because the certification process is one of the ways in which the government wants to inform its citizens about the dangers and threats of foreign nationals to commit crimes against Malawians. The fact that foreign nationals can plot and look like Malawians then tarnishes our reputation. If the process is successful, then all these problems will end because we know that this is a Malawian or a newcomer, so security will be strengthened and our reputation will not be tarnished, ”said Minister of State for Defense and Security Grace Obama. Chiumia says Malawians need to have a patriotic spirit by helping the government to implement policies that aim to serve them professionally."
